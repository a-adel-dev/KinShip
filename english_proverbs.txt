Fish or cut bait
Fish where the fish are

Don't look back; something might be gaining on you
If looks could kill
"If you don't look out for yourself, nobody else will"

Look up and not down
Looking at a hill won't move it

All you need is love
Don't be off with the old love before you are on with the new

There's more than one way to skin a cat
There's no right way to do a wrong thing
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach
The way up is down
"When you're down , the only way is up"
You can't have it both ways
Wealth and content are not always bed-fellows
"Everybody talks about the weather, and nobody does anything about it"
"Some are weatherwise, some are otherwise"
What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
Wedlock is a padlock
The weed of crime bears bitter fruit
A week is a long time in politics
Everyone must pull his own weight
Leave well enough alone
Tired wench and coming butter never did in time agree
"Go West, young man, go West!"
Don't reinvent the wheel
The squeaking wheel gets the grease
The wicked can do nothing against the innocent
"Happy wife, happy life"
"If you take a wife from hell, she will bring you back"
A wife is not a guitar you hang on the wall after playing it
The wife is the last to know
"Where there's a will, there's a way"
"If you can't win, don't play"
A win is a win
You can't win if you don't bet
You can't win if you don't play
You can't win them all
You can't win them all if you don't win the first one
You have to be in it to win it
It's an ill wind that blows nobody good
"Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind"
Stronger winds blow slow
"Sometimes you're the windshield, and sometimes you're the bug"
Good wine needs no bush
He that loves wine wants no woes
Old wine is better
Wine does wonders
A wink is as good as a nod 
Winners learn from mistakes
"Winners make the rules, and losers live by them"
"A winner never quits, and a quitter never wins"
Winner take all
You can't have winners without losers
Winning isn't everything
Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing
Nine-tenths of wisdom consists in being wise in time
Wisdom cometh with age
Be careful what you wish for; you might get it
The wish is father to the thought
Wishes won't wash dishes
Wit's in the wane when the moon's in the full
The best witness is a written paper
Woe to the conquered
A good woman is hard to find
Handle with care women and glass
"Never run after a woman or a streetcar; if you miss one, another will come along soon"
Well-behaved women rarely make history
When women are on board there is no want of wind
Women and elephants never forget
Women and linen look best by candlelight
A woman and a melon are not to be known by their outsides
Women are like adder's eggs
A woman is as old as she looks
"A woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke"
A woman is a woman
The woman pays
A woman's place is any place she wants to be
A woman's place is beside her husband
A woman's place is in the home
A woman's place is in the House and Senate
A woman should be barefoot and pregnant
Woman was made for man
A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle
A woman without a man is like a fish without a net
A woman's word is never done
A woman's work is never done
Women: You can't live with them and you can't live without them
Wonders never cease
The woods are full of (something)
Wood warms a man twice
The big word is Service
Fine words butter no parsnips
"Keep your word, though it break your neck"
A kind word is never lost
Let your word be as good as your bond
Make it a word and a blow
Many a true word is spoken in jest
One's word is his bond
One word is as good as a thousand
One's word is law
The plainest words are the most profitable oratory in the weightiest matters
Polite words open iron gates
There's no such word as can't
A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver
A word to the wise is sufficient
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Good work requires good tools
Hard work is the best country doctor
Hard work never hurt anyone
"The harder the work you do for the devil, the more death you get for wages"
"The harder you work, the luckier you get"
The hardest work is to do nothing
He that will not work shall not eat
It's all in a day's work
It works if you work it
Nice work if you can get it
There is no work in the grave
Work before you play
Work expands to fill the available time
Work is work
"Work smart, not hard"
Work with what you have
A workman is known by his chips
All the world's a stage
All the world loves a clown
All the world loves a lover
Don't try to save the world
"Give to the world your best, and it will come back to you"
It's a dog-eat-dog world
It's a small world
The world hates a quitter
The world hates a whiner
The world is a place
The world is my oyster
The world is what people make it
The world owes one a living
The world was not made in a day
The world will do its own business
You can't save the world 
Tread on a worm and it will turn
"Don't worry, be happy"
Worry is interest paid on trouble before it is due
Worry is like a rocking chair; it gives you something to do but doesn't get you anywhere
Worry is the rust that spoils the knife-blade
The worst always happens to the man who is ready to believe the worst
The worst is yet to come
Two wrongs don't make a right
The first five years are the hardest
The first hundred years are the hardest
"A hundred years is not much, but never is a long while"
"It's not the years, it's the mileage"
"Yes, we can"
"Yesterday is gone, tomorrow may never come, today is here"
Yesterday's hits win no runs today
One is not as young as one used to be
You are only young once
One is not getting any younger
Be yourself
Youth comes but once 
Youth is wasted on the young
Youth must have its fling
There's no zealot like a convert
You can tell a zebra by its stripes
A zebra cannot change its stripes
The most important erogenous zone is the brain
